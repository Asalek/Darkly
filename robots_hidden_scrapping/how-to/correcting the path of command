# Robots File Accessed

## how i've found the flag

1_ after getting the page from robots.txt, go to x.x.x.x/.hidden
2_ notice too many folders no problem use this command :
* wget -r -e robots=off --no-parent http://x.x.x.x/.hidden/
the command will downlaod all folders
3_ look for a flag text inside thies folders with this command :
* grep -r "flag" path/to/hidden
path/to/hidden : represent the folder that contains all the folder you downloaded with wget
4_ enjoy the flag (^_^)


#Fix:

you can make it less accessible by:


Renaming the file: You can rename the file to something else, like robotstxt.txt or crawl-control.txt. This way, it's not easily discoverable by typing /robots.txt in the URL.
Moving the file: You can move the file to a non-standard location, like /admin/robotstxt.txt or /private/crawl-control.txt. This makes it harder for people to find by guessing the URL.
Using a redirect: You can set up a redirect from /robots.txt to a non-existent page or a page that says "Access denied". This way, even if someone tries to access the file directly, they'll be redirected elsewhere.
Using a password protection: You can password-protect the directory where the robots.txt file is located. This way, only authorized users can access the file.
Keep in mind that these methods won't completely hide the file from search engines, as they can still find it through other means, like:

*Crawling the website's HTML code
*Analyzing the website's HTTP headers
*Using other crawl paths
